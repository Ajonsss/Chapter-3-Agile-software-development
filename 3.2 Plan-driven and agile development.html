        <h1>3.2 Plan-driven and agile development</h1>
    </header>

    <main>

        <p>Agile approaches to software development consider design and implementation to be
            the central activities in the software process. They incorporate other activities, such as
            requirements elicitation and testing, into design and implementation. By contrast, a
            plan-driven approach to software engineering identifies separate stages in the software process with outputs
            associated with each stage. The outputs from one stage are
            used as a basis for planning the following process activity. Figure 3.2 shows the distinctions between
            plan-driven and agile approaches to system specification</p>
        <p>In a plan-driven approach, iteration occurs within activities with formal documents used to communicate
            between stages of the process. For example, the requirements will evolve and, ultimately, a requirements
            specification will be produced.
            This is then an input to the design and implementation process. In an agile approach,
            iteration occurs across activities. Therefore, the requirements and the design are
            developed together, rather than separately</p>

        <p>A plan-driven software process can support incremental development and delivery. It is perfectly feasible to
            allocate requirements and plan the design and development phase as a series of increments. An agile process
            is not inevitably code-focused
            and it may produce some design documentation. As I discuss in the following section, the agile development
            team may decide to include a documentation ‘spike’,
            where, instead of producing a new version of a system, the team produce system
            documentation.</p>

        <p>In fact, most software projects include practices from plan-driven and agile
            approaches. To decide on the balance between a plan-based and an agile approach,
            you have to answer a range of technical, human, and organizational questions:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Is it important to have a very detailed specification and design before moving to
                implementation? If so, you probably need to use a plan-driven approach.
            </li>
            <li>Is an incremental delivery strategy, where you deliver the software to customers
                and get rapid feedback from them, realistic? If so, consider using agile methods.
            </li>
            <li>How large is the system that is being developed? Agile methods are most effective when the system can be
                developed with a small co-located team who can
                communicate informally. This may not be possible for large systems that require
                larger development teams so a plan-driven approach may have to be used.
            </li>
            <li>What type of system is being developed? Systems that require a lot of analysis
                before implementation (e.g., real-time system with complex timing requirements) usually need a fairly
                detailed design to carry out this analysis. A plandriven approach may be best in those circumstances.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li> What is the expected system lifetime? Long-lifetime systems may require more
            design documentation to communicate the original intentions of the system developers to the support team.
            However, supporters of agile methods rightly
            argue that documentation is frequently not kept up to date and it is not of much
            use for long-term system maintenance.
        </li>
        <li> What technologies are available to support system development? Agile methods
            often rely on good tools to keep track of an evolving design. If you are developing a system using an IDE
            that does not have good tools for program visualization and analysis, then more design documentation may be
            required.
        </li>
        <li>How is the development team organized? If the development team is distributed
            or if part of the development is being outsourced, then you may need to develop
            design documents to communicate across the development teams. You may
            need to plan in advance what these are.
        </li>
        <li>Are there cultural issues that may affect the system development? Traditional
            engineering organizations have a culture of plan-based development, as this is
            the norm in engineering. This usually requires extensive design documentation,
            rather than the informal knowledge used in agile processes.
        </li>
        <li>How good are the designers and programmers in the development team? It is
            sometimes argued that agile methods require higher skill levels than plan-based
            approaches in which programmers simply translate a detailed design into code.
            If you have a team with relatively low skill levels, you may need to use the best
            people to develop the design, with others responsible for programming.</li>
        <li>Is the system subject to external regulation? If a system has to be approved by an
            external regulator (e.g., the Federal Aviation Authority [FAA] approve software
            that is critical to the operation of an aircraft) then you will probably be required
            to produce detailed documentation as part of the system safety case.
        </li>

            <p>In reality, the issue of whether a project can be labelled as plan-driven or agile is
                not very important. Ultimately, the primary concern of buyers of a software system
                is whether or not they have an executable software system that meets their needs and
                does useful things for the individual user or the organization. In practice, many companies who claim to
                have used agile methods have adopted some agile practices and
                have integrated these with their plan-driven processes.</p>

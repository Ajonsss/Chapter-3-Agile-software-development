        <section class="section">
            <p class="paragraph"> Businesses now operate in a global, rapidly changing environment. They have to
                respond to new opportunities and markets, changing economic conditions, and the
                emergence of competing products and services. Software is part of almost all busi
                ness operations so new software is developed quickly to take advantage of new
                opportunities and to respond to competitive pressure. Rapid development and deliv
                ery is therefore now often the most critical requirement for software systems. In fact,
                many businesses are willing to trade off software quality and compromise on
                requirements to achieve faster deployment of the software that they need.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> Because these businesses are operating in a changing environment, it is often prac
                tically impossible to derive a complete set of stable software requirements. The initial
                requirements inevitably change because customers find it impossible to predict how a
                system will affect working practices, how it will interact with other systems, and what
                user operations should be automated. It may only be after a system has been delivered
                and users gain experience with it that the real requirements become clear. Even then,
                the requirements are likely to change quickly and unpredictably due to external fac
                tors. The software may then be out of date when it is delivered.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <p class="paragraph">Software development processes that plan on completely specifying the requirements
                and then designing, building, and testing the system are not geared to rapid software
                development. As the requirements change or as requirements problems are discovered,
                the system design or implementation has to be reworked and retested. As a consequence,
                a conventional waterfall or specification-based process is usually prolonged and the final
                software is delivered to the customer long after it was originally specified.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> For some types of software, such as safety-critical control systems, where a com
                plete analysis of the system is essential, a plan-driven approach is the right one.
                However, in a fast-moving business environment, this can cause real problems. By
                the time the software is available for use, the original reason for its procurement may
                have changed so radically that the software is effectively useless. Therefore, for busi
                ness systems in particular, development processes that focus on rapid software
                development and delivery are essential.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <p class="paragraph">The need for rapid system development and processes that can handle changing
                requirements has been recognized for some time. IBM introduced incremental
                development in the 1980s (Mills et al., 1980). The introduction of so-called fourth
                generation languages, also in the 1980s, supported the idea of quickly developing
                and delivering software (Martin, 1981). However, the notion really took off in the
                late 1990s with the development of the notion of agile approaches such as DSDM
                (Stapleton, 1997), Scrum (Schwaber and Beedle, 2001), and extreme programming
                (Beck, 1999; Beck, 2000).</p>

        <section class="section">
            <p class="paragraph"> Rapid software development processes are designed to produce useful software
                quickly. The software is not developed as a single unit but as a series of increments, with
                each increment including new system functionality. Although there are many
                approaches to rapid software development, they share some fundamental characteristics:</p>
            <ol class="olists">
                <li class="paragraph">The processes of specification, design, and implementation are interleaved.
                    There is no detailed system specification, and design documentation is mini
                    mized or generated automatically by the programming environment used to implement the system. The
                    user requirements document only defines the most
                    important characteristics of the system.</li>
                <li class="paragraph">The system is developed in a series of versions. End-users and other system
                    stakeholders are involved in specifying and evaluating each version. They may
                    propose changes to the software and new requirements that should be imple
                    mented in a later version of the system.</li>
                <li class="paragraph">System user interfaces are often developed using an interactive development
                    system that allows the interface design to be quickly created by drawing and plac
                    ing icons on the interface. The system may then generate a web-based interface for
                    a browser or an interface for a specific platform such as Microsoft Windows.</li>
                

                <p class="paragraph"> Agile methods are incremental development methods in which the increments are
                    small and, typically, new releases of the system are created and made available to cus
                    tomers every two or three weeks. They involve customers in the development process
                    to get rapid feedback on changing requirements. They minimize documentation by
                    using informal communications rather than formal meetings with written documents.</p>
